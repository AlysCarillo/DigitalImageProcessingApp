# Digital Image Processing App

In this app, you can process your image into the following filters:

- Basic Copy
- Greyscale
- Color Inversion
- Sepia 

You can also produce a `histogram` of the image and as well as `change the background` of the image given that the image to be processed has a green background already.

## Basic Copy
It just simply copies your loaded picture to the processed image box.

## Greyscale
It filters your image to shades of grey.

## Color Inversion
This inverts the colors of your image, removing the light from the color values.

## Sepia
This filters your image to a reddish-brown color tint, like that of an old photograph.

## Histogram 
This produces a histogram of the image, a data that is easy to analyze on the mathematical scale.

## Subtract 
This changes the green background of the image to that of the loaded background image file.
